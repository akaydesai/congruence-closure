# congruence-closure
Verification of the congruence closure algorithm in Coq using dependent types.

Main Files with final proofs:
transitive_closure_rewrite.v,
congruence_closure_rewrite_suffix.v (With changed type for merge)

Other files contain different proof strategies in various stages on completion. Some of which are doomed. :)
